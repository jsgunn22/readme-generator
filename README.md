# Readme Generator

## Description

Often times creating a README.md can be a tedious chore. Getting the layout right, creating sections that are relevant, etc. The readme generator is an application that will build a README based on responsives given from the user. The uniform template helps to make sure that all criteria spoken for so that other users/contributors of a given application can see important information about the project. Gone are the days of building a README one line at a time. Just initialize the generator, answer a few questions, and the README is printed in the directory.
